# Portfolio website

This is the repository for my website. I use github to host the files

> You can use the provided source code, but only leave the images please ;)

### Tools

I have used some projects to get an idea:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [responsive-nav] - awesome responsive navigation
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [jQuery] - very useful
